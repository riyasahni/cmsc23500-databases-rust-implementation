I am obviously planning to use my submission for this Milestone.

This project was extremely difficult. I don't think I had sufficient documentation
to understand what was going on early enough. I started this project the day I got it,
and I've already spent upwards of 60 hours trying to complete it. I've attended every OH 
that I could make, and almost always never get my questions answered, because they involve
debugging. It takes an extremely long time to debug via Ed.

I'm not enjoying this all. Very unfair to students who have never had experience with a systems
class before.
